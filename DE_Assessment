#4.	Write python code that can take csv and convert it into an array of json OR take an array of JSON and convert it into a CSV file with the same column names. This code should be able to write to a file in either CSV or JSON format, the user should be able to pick the output type. If someone picks the same output type as the input type it should write out that file still.
# csv contains columns id, name, description, commas_used, created_at, updated_at
